# BPMgolf

Description: Try to calculate the beats per minute after hearing 8 clicks. The difference between your guess and the actual BPM will be added together for your score. Lowest score wins. This program was built using kivy and ultimately meant to be used as a game/training app on ios/android.

            2) Click the play button and listen for the tempo. 
            3) Enter your tempo/BPM guess.
            4) After 9 'holes' your score will appear! 
            
            
Future Updates: 1) Connect to server to share scores.
